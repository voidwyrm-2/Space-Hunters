# Space-Hunters
## Made with Python via pygame!


A cool space invader game made with pygame (using definitely not ~~stolen~~ *borrowed* code)

I'm gonna have so much fun working on this!


### Features:
* Cool art made by me
* The ability to switch between ship and enemy skins
* Nice feeling controls? I guess? I don't actually know, I'm just randomly saying buzzwords
* Cool saving system that only one-fifth works
* It's made in Python(so no semiolons!)



## Other stuff

All art except the background is made by me(still working on that)(also very proud of the shading on PoliceCruiser.png and SpaceHunter-42B.png)

Music is not made by me

this is built off of [this](https://github.com/meezan-mallick/space_invader_game) space invaders game(really glad I found it since it's really helped me to understand how pygame works)
